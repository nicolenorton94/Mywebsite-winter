            <p>Churchill House, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building. Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.</p>

        <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Offices,_Belconnen">Cameron Offices</a>, <a href="https://nga.gov.au">National Gallery of Australia</a> and <a href="https://www.hcourt.gov.au">High Court of Australia</a>.</p>



        <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:

            - Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.
            - Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.

            The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.

            Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.
